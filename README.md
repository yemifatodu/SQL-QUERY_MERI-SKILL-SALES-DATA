SQL QUERY IN DATA CLEANING PROCESS

   - **Select All Data**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Sale_Data];
     ```

   - **Drop a Column** ( `Unnamed: 0`):
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Sale_Data]
     DROP COLUMN [Unnamed: 0];
     ```

   - **Rename a Column** (`Unnamed: 7` to `Month`):
     ```sql
     EXEC sp_rename '[dbo].[Sale_Data].[Unnamed: 7]', 'Months', 'COLUMN';
     ```

   - **Split `Order Date` into `Date_Only` and `Time_Only`**:
     SQL Server doesnâ€™t directly support splitting strings into multiple columns in a single statement. However, I did it using `SUBSTRING` and `CHARINDEX`:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Sale_Data]
     ADD [Date_Only] DATE, [Time_Only] TIME;

     UPDATE [dbo].[Sale_Data]
     SET [Date_Only] = CAST([Order Date] AS DATE),
         [Time_Only] = CAST([Order Date] AS TIME);

     -- Drop the original Order Date column
     ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Sale_Data]
     DROP COLUMN [Order Date];
     ```

   - **Example: Grouping Sales by Month**:
     ```sql
     SELECT Month, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
     FROM [dbo].[Sale_Data]
     GROUP BY Month
     ORDER BY Month;
     ```

### 1. **Sales Trend Over Time (Top Left Chart)**

```sql
-- SQL Query to get monthly sales trend for 2019
SELECT 
    STRFTIME('%m', [Order Date]) AS Month,
    SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM 
    SalesData
WHERE 
    STRFTIME('%Y', [Order Date]) = '2019'
GROUP BY 
    STRFTIME('%m', [Order Date])
ORDER BY 
    STRFTIME('%m', [Order Date]);
```

**Explanation**: This query calculates the total sales for each month in 2019, allowing you to analyze sales trends over time.

GROUP BY 
    Product
ORDER BY 
    SUM([Quantity Ordered]) DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- SQL Query to get top 10 products by total sales
SELECT 
    Product, 
    SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales

    SalesData A
JOIN 
    SalesData B ON A.[Order ID] = B.[Order ID] AND A.Product != B.Product
WHERE 
    STRFTIME('%Y', A.[Order Date]) = '2019'
GROUP BY 
    A.Product, B.Product
ORDER BY 
    Correlation_Count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Explanation**: This query checks for orders where two different products were purchased together, which helps in understanding product correlations.
